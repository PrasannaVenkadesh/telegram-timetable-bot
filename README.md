## Telegram Timetable Bot - Python

This is a telegram bot script that I wrote which when called with specific commands will reply with the respective academic class
schedule for the day.

This script can be improved a lot. I have intentionally structured it in a bad way (for example, could have created generic functions) hoping any of my class mates would pick it up & make it better.

This bot consumes the Telegram BOT API through [python-telegram-bot library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-telegram-bot/2.2)

Using cronjobs in GNU/Linux operating systems, this script can be run for every `n` sec/min/hrs/days to check messages simulating long polling.

I am putting this under GPL-v3 (read license.txt file) which is a copyleft free software license.
